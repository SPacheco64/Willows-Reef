A website designed and developed for Willow's Reef, LLC.

Overview: This is the code for a website designed and developed for the company Willow's Reef, LLC. The website was created to be a more customized, and better performing replacement for their old WordPress-based website. The design is wholly original, made in conjunction with the client's wishes. All pages were built from the ground-up to match the requirements set forth by the client.

Tech Used:
- HTML5
- SCSS
- JS/jQuery
- Bootstrap 5
- JSON
- PHP

Project Requirements:
- Layout & Style needed to be clear, concise, and fit inline with the brand's image.
- The performance for the website needed to be enhanced, vastly cutting back on load times to keep user's on the site.
- The site is meant to be informational (not currently meant for direct sales, but leading users to partnered sellers).
- The following pages were needed: Homepage, Products pages, Stores pages (Retail & Wholesale), Media pages, About Us, Contact Us Form.
- New content needed to be written for the website.

Site Breakdown:
- Global Header: A responsive header containing site navigation. This header is loaded onto each page during page load.
- Homepage: Contains all upfront information the client wants the user to see, including links to the About Us page, Community Images page, and Products.
- Products (All): Contains 4 product previews, with each product having its own informational page to link off to.
- Products (Individual Pages): Each Individual Products page contains information on the products, and a pop-up showing recommended online stores to purchase each product from.
- Retail Stores: This page is populated by a list of partnered retail stores. This list is stored as JSON data, which is formed by converting Excel Spreadsheets made by the client into an appropriate JSON format. Stores are split into US and UK groups.
-  Wholesale Stores: This page shows the logos of each of the partnered wholesale stores, separated into groups by country. Clicking on a logo provides the user with a pop-up that gives that store's contact & location information.
-  Blog: Currently set up with a "Coming Soon" modal. This will eventually link to an external blog the client plans to set up.
-  Community Images: A page containing a gallery of user-submitted images. Will grow in size and contain more images over time.
-  Feeding Videos Playlist:  Currently set up with a "Coming Soon" modal. Will eventually contain an embedded YouTube playlist from their YouTube channel.
-  About Us: Contains information about the company that I wrote for the client alongside them.
-  Contact Us Form: A php contact form found at the bottom of each page, right above the global footer.
-  Global Footer: A responsive footer containing social media navigation. This footer is loaded onto each page during page load.
